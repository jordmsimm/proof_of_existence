# Avoiding Common Attacks #
My approach to avoiding common attacks was to keep things simple. The Existence contract does not handle user's ether, so this along disqualifies many attacks including most of the well known attacks. Some features that were used to help prevent attacks would be emergency stop logic, only onwner modifier, and data authentication before storage.
