# Design Pattern Decisions #
For my contract design I chose to keep all of my logic in 1 main contract. I knew that my solidity code would be smaller becuase of using IPFS, so using many contracts would be unfeasable. I was initially going to store all data in the Existence.sol until I discovered how to store json data on ipfs.
