# proof_of_existence
A decentralized application used for storing different types of media and data for evidence of its existence at a given time. Data is stored on the interplanetary file system (IPFS), then the hash of the datas location is stored on the ethereum blockchain with an immutable timestamp to gurantee existence of the data.
### Development Tools ###
  * [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)
  * [truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
  * [metamask](https://metamask.io/)
  * [uport](https://www.uport.me/)

### Interact with rinkeby and uport ###
The smart contracts are deployed on the rinkeby network and the artifacts are in the build folder. To interact with the dApp, use the uPort mobile app. To start the dApp use the commands below.

Install dependencies:
  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
  
Run dev server:
```shell
  npm run start
```

View app at: 
```shell
  localhost:3000
```

Then, use the uPort mobile app to sign in and add existences.
